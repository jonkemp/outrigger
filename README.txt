Child Themes

Outrigger is designed for use with child themes. The default CSS included with the theme is minimal. It is meant to be. It is only there to provide legibility when no child theme is available and not meant to be used on public facing web sites.

A child theme in WordPress is relatively simple to build. The main thing you need is your CSS file, style.css. A functions.php file is optional but not necessary.
